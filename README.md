# Quantum Computing at UNT

This repository provides an archive for code backing quantum-computing papers in Marco Buongiorno Nardelli's group at the University of North Texas.

- `BandTheory` - Backs arXiv:2104.03409.
- `DirectSpace` - Backs doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-1318951.
- `SelfOrthogonalization` - Backs arXiv:2204.04361.
- See also Dr. Frank Cerasoli's (private) repository Sassafrass6/QCTB backing our very first paper, arXiv:2006.03807.

Please see each individual repository's README for additional details.

#### Notes from Kyle
The quality of the code tends to improve for later papers. ^_^ All the important parts of `BandTheory` are significantly improved in `DirectSpace` so I recommend ignoring the former unless questions about the associated paper arise.

My projects (`BandTheory`, `DirectSpace`, `SelfOrthogonalization`) are skeletonized versions of the most important project spaces that I used throughout my dissertation. I'll keep a more complete archive for a couple years, so that if you have any problems with this code base or if you have any questions about other work I did, you can ask me at kmsherbert@yahoo.com.

Finally, beware that I did _not_ test this code before uploading it to Github. There could very easily be some version issues I didn't anticipate in the "Dependencies" section of each README file. I trust that learning how to _get_ the code to work will be an effective first step for any new students to learn _how_ the code works. ^_^ The first script I list in the "Code Description" of each README file is in some sense the most "important". That's where you should start trying to understand the code, but I _expect_ you to have to follow imports and get to know the whole library. If you get stuck, I'm always happy to help.
